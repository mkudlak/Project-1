# Project-3 - Creating page with SASS
Exercise from bootcamp Kodilla https://kodilla.com/pl/courses

The task was:

- create style.scss files.
- copy the CSS code to the style.scss file.
- correct the code to be compatible with the SCSS syntax.
- use nesting instead of extensive CSS selectors in places where it's possible to make your code more readable.
- find repeating colors and create variables that will replace them.
- certainly you have some recurring classes in your code 
- try to sort them using the @extend rule - the shorter code is more readable for the developer.
If you use CSS rules with your prefixes (eg -webkit, -moz), replace them with the appropriate mixins.



Project based on framework Bootstrap and SASS
